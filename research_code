#1 - I tried being extremely specific as to where to conduct the regression and at every hundredth quantile
dlr <- dynrq(explore ~ L(explore,2) + L(explore, 21), tau = 99/100, start = c(2,2), end = c(87,21))

#2 - I tried converting the data to both a list and matrix. However I now know that the data must be a time series

dlr <- dynrq(myts ~ L(myts,1))

#3 - This was the last thing I was trying the transformation suggested on StackOverflow. Still have issues converting the Matlab
# 'eye' function into R when I revisit this project over winter break I may end up just trying to do it in Matlab
